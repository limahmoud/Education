Educational Equity and Performance in Egyptian Governorates

📝 Overview

This project provides a data-driven analysis of Egypt’s education system across different governorates, educational stages, and school types. Using visual dashboards, the analysis highlights critical issues such as student density, teacher distribution, gender-based performance, and the comparison between public and private schools.

🎯 Objectives

Identify the most crowded governorates and school stages.

Examine the teacher-to-student ratio in various regions.

Analyze differences in student performance by gender.

Compare performance and student density across school types.

Provide actionable insights and policy recommendations to improve education quality.

📊 Key Insights

Giza and Cairo have the highest student density.

Female students outperform males in overall performance.

Public schools suffer from higher overcrowding and relatively weaker performance compared to private and international schools.

Secondary education has better teacher/student ratios than primary or preparatory stages.

✅ Recommendations

Increase the number of teachers in high-density governorates.

Build more classrooms, especially for primary education.

Encourage expansion of private and experimental education in crowded areas.

Launch academic support programs for male students.

Invest in public schools to raise their performance levels.
